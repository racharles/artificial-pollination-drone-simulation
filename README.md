# DART-Sim

DART-Sim (Drone-based Autonomous Robotic Testbed for Simulation) allows for the development of a drone-based autonomous pollination robot with sub-centimeter precision powered with deep-learning algorithms. DART-Sim features VSLAM algorithms such as monocular ORB-SLAM2 integrated with state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning algorithms like YOLO v5 for object detection, which enables sub-centimeter precision in localization and mapping. It is based on the popular ROS framework integrated with Gazebo, Rviz, and MoveIt. The working prototype testbed DART-Sim v1 is capable of a full-scale simulation of robotic artificial pollination system in a simulated indoor greenhouse environment for tomato plants with GPS denied autonomous navigation. It also features a proof-of-concept prototype of an end-effector using a novel sprayer-based pollination mechanism as an attachable drone payload. This research demonstrates the feasibility and viability of a simulation-based approach for studying and building an autonomous precision pollination robot.

This research project was entered into the Regeneron Science Talent Search 2021. However, this research is still ongoing, and I plan to develop this project further and eventually present my work at a research conference.
